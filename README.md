# Task Lists Frontend

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) frontend project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

### Development Server

To start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the app.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

### Using Docker Compose

You can also run the frontend (and backend, if configured) using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose up
```

This will build and start the frontend service (and backend if included in your `docker-compose.yaml`).  
By default, the frontend will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
